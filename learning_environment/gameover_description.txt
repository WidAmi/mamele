# Format is 
# gamename:
# for which game the description corresponds to
# This can be multiple games, one per line

# The game over descriptions start with an @ symbol
# @:<cpu>:<address_space>:address:bit:<1|0> 
# address and bit are zero-based, so bit 1 is the 2nd bit
# last 1 or 0 is whether we are detecting the presence of a 1 or a 0
# address_space is ignored at the moment
