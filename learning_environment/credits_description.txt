# Where the game credits sit and how to read that score
# Follows something vaguely similar to what hiscore.dat does for the memory range.  
# It does not try to make an all-powerful encoding system, but instead will limit to major
# schemes which will be given names.

# Format is 
# gamename:
# for which game the description corresponds to
# This can be multiple games, one per line

# The credits descriptions start with an @ symbol
# @:<cpu>:<address_space>:<address_start>:<length>:<format>
# address_space is ignored at the moment
